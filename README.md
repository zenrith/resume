# AI Engineer in training

#### Summary:
Currently an AI Apprentice. I hope to fill the role of an AI Engineer in the near future.

## ðŸŽ“ Education
**B.Sc.**, Data Science and Analytics, National University of Singapore (Jan 2019 - Jun 2023)

## ðŸ’¼ Work experience
AI Apprentice @ AI Singapore, (Jan 2024 â€“ Present)
- Hip Fracture Detection Project (Computer Vision)
    - Currently working on developing a computer vision system to help identify hip fractures in X-rays

Business Intelligence Intern @ Abbott Medical (May 2022 â€“ Jun 2023)
- Customer Segmentation Project (Marketing analytics)
    - Combined outlier detection and data clustering techniques to automatically segment customers based on recency, frequency, and monetary features.
    - Designed and built a frontend that enabled the marketing team to:
        - Filter customer data according to chosen data fields.
        - Apply the clustering model to filtered data and view post-clustering insights.

- Commentary Analysis Project (Natural Language Processing)
    - Data collection: Collected a dataset using 4 yearsâ€™ worth of financial commentaries and product information by scraping data from financial documents.
    - Data labelling: Established labelling rules to guide manual labeling, then semi-manually labelled collected dataset of around 1400 samples.
    - Text classifier development: Trained a transformer-based text classifier after experimenting with various families of models. Achieved 85% accuracy.
    - Span extractor development: 
        - Adapted a state-of-the-art deep learning model specialized in span extraction. Trained a model that extracts spans from a sentence with around 65% exact match.
        - Modified evaluation metrics to obtain metrics like ROUGE and BLEU.
    - Frontend development: Designed and built a frontend that utilized the text classifier.

Data Analyst Intern @ Lunch Actually (Jun 2021 â€“ Aug 2021)
- Refund Analysis Project (Dashboard Design)
    - Collected 3 yearsâ€™ worth of reasons for refunds. Recategorized refund reasons and merged dataset with existing database data to obtain additional data fields.
    - Designed and presented a data story to higher management with the motivation of:
        - Better understanding reasons for refunds
        - Suggesting ways of improving methods of data collection.

- Leads Analysis Project (Dashboard Design)
    - Curated a dataset of 3 yearsâ€™ worth of lead information by manipulating database tables 
    - Modelled sales funnel using information gathered from the Head of Sales
    - Designed and built a dashboard that displayed the demographics of clients at the different stages of the sales funnel

## ðŸŽ§ Personal Projects
 - [Ames regression](https://github.com/zenrith/ames-regression)

    - Developed a regression model to predict house prices using the Ames dataset. Model performance ranked around top 20% on the Kaggle leaderboard.
    - Packaged and published the developed model on Pypi
    - Built an API to use the model as a service
    - Automated building and testing with continuous integration

- [Customer Review Analytics (class project)](https://github.com/zenrith/DSA4263-Voice-of-Customer-VOC-analysis)
    - Built a module that my teammates could use to select an appropriate topic model for a given dataset, train a topic model, and perform topic model inference.
    - Built topic model related unit tests

- Emotion recognition (class project)
    - Collected dataset (~3000 samples) by scraping pictures of human faces displaying a type of emotion from Google. Each sample was then labelled with an appropriate emotion.
    - Manually crafted model architectures inspired by early computer vision architectures. Trained these models and settled on a model pipeline that yielded 55% test accuracy.
